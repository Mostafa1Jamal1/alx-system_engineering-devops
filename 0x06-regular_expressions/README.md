This directory of files for the 0x06.Regular expression project
All the files and directory is described here
If any file or directory that is not described may be for testing purposes


For this project, all the regular expressions built using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.

Because the focus of this exercise is to play with regular expressions (regex), here is the Ruby code that you should use, just replace the regexp part, meaning the code in between the //
```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join
```

`0-simply_match_school.rb` -> a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method
- The regular expression must match School


`1-repetition_token_0.rb` -> a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method
